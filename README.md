# 2-project-ASA-2014-15
2ยบ project for Analysis and Synthesis Algorithms (ASA) class in 2ยบ semester from 2014/15 (Instituto Superior Tecnico - IST professor Vasco Manquinho )

grade: 20/20

I based myself on the paper presented on file e0082.pdf.
The problem in this project was to find the shortest path to a source with negative weight arcs, and in the end we needed to identify the nodes on the graph that below to a negative cycle.
